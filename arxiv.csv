https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02781,"Summary: We present a preliminary investigation of algebraic surfaces that have non-planar degenerations, along with their Galois covers and fundamental groups. Specifically, we investigate the tetrahedron and the double tetrahedron. The resulting fundamental groups indicate that the tetrahedron and the double tetrahedron are in different components of the moduli space of algebraic surfaces."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11698,"Summary: Two commonly studied compactifications of Teichmüller spaces of finite type surfaces with respect to the Teichmüller metric are the horofunction and visual compactifications. We show that these two compactifications are related, by proving that the horofunction compactification is finer than the visual compactification. This allows us to use the simplicity of the visual compactification to obtain topological properties of the horofunction compactification. Among other things, we show that the horoboundary of Teichmüller space is path connected and that its Busemann points are not dense, we determine for which surfaces the horofunction compactification is isomorphic to the visual one, and we show that some horocycles diverge in the visual compactification based at some point. As an ingredient in one of the proofs we show that extremal length is not $C^{2}$ along some paths that are smooth with respect to the piecewise linear structure on measured foliations."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00261,"Summary: Intersection homology is defined for simplicial, singular and PL chains and it is well known that the three versions are isomorphic for a full filtered simplicial complex. In the literature, the isomorphism, between the singular and the simplicial situations of intersection homology, uses the PL case as an intermediate. Here we show directly that the canonical map between the simplicial and the singular intersection chains complexes is a quasi-isomorphism. This is similar to the classical proof for simplicial complexes, with an argument based on the concept of residual complex and not on skeletons. This parallel between simplicial and singular approaches is also extended to the intersection blown-up cohomology that we introduced in a previous work. In the case of an orientable pseudomanifold, this cohomology owns a Poincaré isomorphism with the intersection homology, for any coefficient ring, thanks to a cap product with a fundamental class. So, the blown-up intersection cohomology of a pseudomanifold can be computed from a triangulation. Finally, we introduce a blown-up intersection cohomology for PL spaces and prove that it is isomorphic to the singular one."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06086,"Summary: A time change of a flow $\{T_t\}$, ${t\in\mathbb{R}}$, is a reparametrization of the orbits of the flow such that each orbit is mapped to itself by an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the parameter space. If a flow $\{S_t\}$ is isomorphic to a flow obtained by a reparametrization of a flow $\{T_t\}$, then we say that $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$ are isomorphic up to a time change. For ergodic flows $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$, Kakutani showed that this happens if and only if the two flows have Kakutani equivalent transformations as cross-sections. We prove that the Kakutani equivalence relation on ergodic invertible measure-preserving transformations of a standard non-atomic probability space is not a Borel set. This shows in a precise way that classification of ergodic transformations up to Kakutani equivalence is impossible. In particular, our results imply the non-classifiability of ergodic flows up to isomorphism after a time change. Moreover, we obtain anti-classification results under isomorphism for ergodic invertible transformations of a sigma-finite measure space. We also obtain anti-classification results under Kakutani equivalence for ergodic area-preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk, annulus, and 2-torus, as well as real-analytic diffeomorphisms of the $2$-torus. Our work generalizes the anti-classification results under isomorphism for ergodic transformations obtained by Foreman, Rudolph, and Weiss."
https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05966,"Summary: This article constructs the moduli stack of torsionfree $G$-jet-structures in homotopy type theory with one monadic modality. This yields a construction of this moduli stack for any $\infty$-topos equipped with any stable factorization systems. In the intended applications of this theory, the factorization systems are given by the deRham-Stack construction. Homotopy type theory allows a formulation of this abstract theory with surprising low complexity. This is witnessed by the accompanying formalization of large parts of this work."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00482,"Summary: Lurie's theorem states that there exists a sheaf of ring spectra on the site of formally étale Deligne--Mumford stacks over the moduli stack of $p$-divisible groups of height $n$, which agrees with the classical Landweber exact functor theorem (LEFT) on affines. In other words, this theorem is a global, higher categorical refinement of the LEFT. In recent work, Lurie has introduced many of the ingredients one needs to prove this theorem, and in this article, we gather these ingredients together and prove Lurie's theorem. Applications of this theorem to Lubin--Tate theories, topological modular and automorphism forms, and Adams operations are also discussed."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09259,"Summary: In this paper, we study stable ergodicity of the action of groups of diffeomorphisms on smooth manifolds. Such actions are known to exist only on one-dimensional manifolds. The aim of this paper is to introduce a geometric method to overcome this restriction and to construct higher dimensional examples. In particular, we show that every closed manifold admits stably ergodic finitely generated group actions by diffeomorphisms of class $C^{1+\alpha}$. We also prove the stable ergodicity of certain algebraic actions, including the natural action of a generic pair of matrices near the identity on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. These are consequences of the quasi-conformal blender, a local and stable mechanism/phenomenon introduced in this paper, which encapsulates our method for proving stable local ergodicity by providing quasi-conformal orbits with fine controlled geometry. The quasi-conformal blender is developed in the context of pseudo-semigroup actions of locally defined smooth diffeomorphisms, which allows for applications in diverse settings."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11988,"Summary: We study the parameter dependence of complex geodesics with prescribed boundary value and direction on bounded strongly linearly convex domains. As an important application we establish a quantitative relationship between the regularity of the pluricomplex Poisson kernel of such a domain, which is a solution to a homogeneous complex Monge--Ampère equation with boundary singularity, and the regularity of the boundary of the domain. Our results greatly improve the previous results of Chang--Hu--Lee and Bracci--Patrizio in this direction."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14473,"Summary: The Gan-Gross-Prasad problem is to describe the restriction of representations of a classical group $G$ to smaller groups $H$ of the same kind. In this paper, we solved the Gan-Gross-Prasad problem over finite fields completely. In previous work \cite{LW1,LW2,LW3,Wang}, we study the Gan-Gross-Prasad problem for unipotent representations of finite classical groups. The main tools used are the Lusztig correspondence as well as a formula of Reeder \cite{R} for the pairings of Deligne-Lusztig characters. We give a reduction decomposition of Reeder's formula, and deduce the Gan-Gross-Prasad problem for arbitrary representations from the unipotent representations by Lusztig correspondence."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05197,"Summary: The present article is concerned with mirror symmetry for generalized K3 surfaces, with particular emphasis on complex and Kähler rigid structures. Inspired by the works of Dolgachev, Aspinwall-Morrison and Huybrechts, we introduce a formulation of mirror symmetry for generalized K3 surfaces by using Mukai lattice polarizations. This approach solves issues in the conventional formulations of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces. In particular, we provide a solution to the problem of mirror symmetry for singular K3 surfaces. Along the way, we investigate complex and Kähler rigid structures of generalized K3 surfaces."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14148,"Summary: Sparse binary matrices are of great interest in the field of sparse recovery, nonnegative compressed sensing, statistics in networks, and theoretical computer science. This class of matrices makes it possible to perform signal recovery with lower storage costs and faster decoding algorithms. In particular, Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices formed by independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli$(p)$ random variables are of practical relevance in the context of noise-blind recovery in nonnegative compressed sensing. In this work, we investigate the robust nullspace property of Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices. Previous results in the literature establish that such matrices can accurately recover $n$-dimensional $s$-sparse vectors with $m=O\left(\frac{s}{c(p)}\log\frac{en}{s}\right)$ measurements, where $c(p) \le p$ is a constant dependent only on the parameter $p$. These results suggest that in the sparse regime, as $p$ approaches zero, the (sparse) Bernoulli$(p)$ matrix requires significantly more measurements than the minimal necessary, as achieved by standard isotropic subgaussian designs. However, we show that this is not the case. Our main result characterizes, for a wide range of sparsity levels $s$, the smallest $p$ for which sparse recovery can be achieved with the minimal number of measurements. We also provide matching lower bounds to establish the optimality of our results and explore connections with the theory of invertibility of discrete random matrices and integer compressed sensing."
