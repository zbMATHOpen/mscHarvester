Miyajima} and \textit{N. Okazawa} [Pac. J. Math. 125, 161-175 (1986; Zbl 0615.47031)]. Secondly they derive reuslts on the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup generated by such an operator.
    
    
    Let us sketch at least the first main result of this important paper: Let \(G\) be a \(d\)-dimensional Lie group and let \(U\) be a strongly continuous representation of \(G\) by bounded linear operators \(U(g)\), acting on the Banach space \(X\). Let \(\{a_ 1,\dots,a_ d\}\) be a fixed basis of the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g\) and define \(A_ i\) to be the generator of \((U(\exp(-ta_ i)))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}\). Let \(C_ m(\xi)=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m} c_ \alpha\xi^ \alpha\) be a strongly elliptic form on \(\mathbb{R}^ d\) and consider \(A_ m=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m} c_ \alpha A^ \alpha\). Then \textit{R. P. Langlands} [``Semigroups and representations of Lie groups'', Doctoral thesis, Yale Univ. (1960, unpublished)] has shown that \(A_ m\) is closabel and that \(\overline A_ m\) generates a holomorphic semigroup \((S_ t)_ t\). Moreover there exists a kernel \(K(t,g)\) on \(\mathbb{R}\times G\), independently of the representation \(U\) such that 
    \[
    S_ t=\int_ G dgK(t,g)U(g).
    \]
     The first main result of the paper under review says that \(K\) is a nonnegative function iff \(m=2\) and all \(c_ \alpha\) are real. Moreover if this condition is satisfied and \(G\) is connected then \(K\) can be estimated from below in an important manner.",

A support is called compactly enclosed if \(T\) is a compact operator. Typical results are of the following kind: Suppose \(X\) does not have a property \((\mathbb{P})\), then there exists a p.m. \(\mu\) on \(X\), which does not have a Banach space with property \((\mathbb{P})\) as a support. It is shown also that any p.m. on a separable Banach space always has as compactly enclosed support a space \(Y\) which is an \(\ell_ 2\)-direct sum of a sequence of finite-dimensional Banach spaces; since \(Y\) is reflexive, this implies the main result of \textit{V. V. Buldygin} [Theory Probab. Appl. 29, 546-549 (1985); translation from Teor. Veroyatn. Primen. 29, No. 3, 528-532 (1984; Zbl 0565.60003)].",

We show that problems of the class considered always have a solution, which is, moreover, unique, because they lead to inhomogeneous complementarity problems in traditional form with positive major minors of the constrained matrix.
    
    
    We describe a solution algorithm that is a concretization of the general scheme of the algorithm of polyhedral complementarity, which was given by the author in an earlier paper [ibid. 44(61), 82-95 (1988; Zbl 0727.90081)]. A problem of this type arose in constructing an algorithm for finding the equilibrium in a linear exchange model [the author, Sib. Math. J. 26, 288-300 (1985); translation from Sib. Mat.
